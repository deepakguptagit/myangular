Scope:

1) Attaching data to scope does not by itself have an impact on performance. If
no watcher is watching a property, it doesn't matter if it's on the scope or
not. Angular does not iterate over properties of scope. It iterates over the
watches.

2) Every watch function is called during every $digest. For this reason, it's a
good idea to pay attention to the number of watches you have, as well as the
performance of each individual watch function or expression.

3) Watch functions should be idempotent: A watch function should have no side
effects or only side effects that can happen any number of times. If, for
example, a watch function fires an Ajax request, there are no guarantees about
how many requests your app is making.
